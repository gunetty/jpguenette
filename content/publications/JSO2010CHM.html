Radiofrequency ablation (RFA) may be performed intraoperatively, laparoscopically, or percutaneously. The percutaneous 
approach is associated with the least procedural risk and may be performed under local anesthesia. Percutaneous RFA should 
be considered a primary treatment option for patients with unresectable hepatic tumors or conditions that prohibit general 
anesthesia or abdominal surgery. Continually improving thermal ablation and imaging technologies are likely to further 
increase tumor ablation efficacy and expand its role in treatment of hepatic metastases.
